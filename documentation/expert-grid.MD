Certainly, let's provide a more detailed README with explanations for each property and method, as if I'm a senior developer explaining it to a junior developer:

# ExpertGrid Class - Detailed README

## Introduction
The `ExpertGrid` class is a powerful JavaScript component designed to make it easy to filter and display a grid of experts on a web page. It allows users to search and browse experts by various criteria like specialty, location, and name. As a junior developer, let's delve into the details of this class.

## Getting Started
To use the `ExpertGrid` class effectively, follow these initial steps:

1. **Include the JavaScript file:** Make sure to include the JavaScript file containing the `ExpertGrid` class in your HTML document.

2. **HTML Structure:** Ensure that your HTML markup includes a grid of expert items. Each item should have data attributes (e.g., `data-location`, `data-specialty`, `data-name`) to define the expert's properties.

3. **Initialize the Class:** Create an instance of the `ExpertGrid` class by providing the grid items as an array to its constructor. This array should contain the expert items you want to display and filter.

Now, let's dive into the class's properties and methods to understand how they work.

## Class Properties
These are the key properties of the `ExpertGrid` class:

- `grid_items`: This property stores an array of expert grid items. Each grid item contains information about an expert's location, specialty, and name.

- `filteredItems`: It's another array that stores the expert grid items that match the selected criteria. This array is dynamically updated as users apply filters.

- `secondary_filter_items`: This property isn't currently used in the provided code. However, it can be extended for additional filtering if needed.

- `offering_grid` and `offering_text`: These properties hold references to HTML elements that represent the offering grid and offering text. They can be used to display additional information related to the experts.

- `sports_medicine_row`, `spine_back_row`, and `all_experts_rows`: These properties are references to HTML elements representing different rows of experts. They control the display of these rows based on the selected filter.

- `filterSelects` and `filterSearch`: These properties store references to HTML elements responsible for user interactions. `filterSelects` represent dropdown selects used for filtering, and `filterSearch` represents a search input field for filtering by expert name.

- `parentGrid`: This property is a reference to the HTML element that contains the expert grid, allowing you to update its contents dynamically.

- `location`, `specialty`, and `name`: These properties hold the currently selected filter values for location, specialty, and name.

- `timer`: It's used for debouncing the search input, ensuring that the filtering action doesn't occur too frequently.

- `initValue`: This property stores the initial specialty value obtained from the URL query parameters, allowing you to preselect a filter when the page loads.

- `option_values_to_text_ids`: It's a mapping of filter option values to corresponding HTML element IDs. This mapping helps in showing and hiding specific paragraphs based on the selected specialty.

- `activePargraph`: A reference to the currently active paragraph based on the selected specialty filter. It's used to control which information is displayed based on the filter.

## Initialization
The `ExpertGrid` class constructor is where everything begins. It accepts an array of expert grid items and sets up the initial state of the class:

- `grid_items`: Pass in an array of expert grid items that you want to display and filter.

- `init()`: After initialization, the `init()` method is called. If there's an initial specialty value obtained from the URL query parameters, this method sets the selected filter, updates the dropdown, and shows the corresponding paragraph.

## Event Handling
Event handling is a crucial part of the `ExpertGrid` class. It allows the class to respond to user interactions:

- `filterSelectHandler()`: This function handles changes in filter select elements (e.g., specialty, location). It updates the filters and controls the visibility of related paragraphs.

- `filterSearchHandler()`: Handles changes in the search input for expert names. It debounces user input and filters the expert grid items accordingly.

## Filtering Experts
The heart of this class is the ability to filter experts based on user-selected criteria:

- `filterGridItems()`: This method filters the expert grid items based on selected criteria (location, specialty, name). It uses regular expressions for matching and updates the `filteredItems` array to reflect the current filter.

## Updating the Grid
Once you've filtered the experts, you need to update the grid's display:

- `updateGrid()`: This method updates the display of expert grid items based on the `filteredItems` array. It replaces the contents of the parent grid element with the filtered items.

## Example Usage
Here's how you can put everything together to use the `ExpertGrid` class in your web application:

1. **Get the Grid Items:** Select the grid items from your HTML markup using `document.querySelectorAll(".expert-item")`.

2. **Initialize the Class:** Create an instance of the `ExpertGrid` class, passing the grid items as an array.

```javascript
const gridItems = document.querySelectorAll(".expert-item");
const expertGrid = new ExpertGrid(gridItems);
```

With this setup, your web application can now provide users with a dynamic and interactive grid of experts, allowing them to search and filter experts by various criteria.

Remember to tailor the class properties and methods to suit the specific needs of your project. Happy coding!
